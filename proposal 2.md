# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mario 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will be making a mario game based off the tutorial on canvas.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In my program I will use python Idle and the features will have the user jump on the blocks and jump onto the flag. The user will then have the option to start a new level or end on that level.
I will make sure the code asks the user if they want to go to the next level or end and go back to the start.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

In my final project I will make sure my code gets done so it produces a game that can be ran.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can finish the whole project before the dealine.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope my code is enough to get a high grade for the project, I at least want an A or B.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will be making my code through python and I might try to make it through pygame to see the difference. I will be researching the end of mario games so I can see how to end off the levels.
I will need good researching skills and good programming skills for this final projecct.
